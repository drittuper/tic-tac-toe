# tic-tac-toe
My first public-worthy version of TicTacToe

Just an upload of my TicTacToeV2 game that I made in order to learn Swing a bit. Sadly, I just made an initial commit after the whole thing was done, hence no commit history. I hope to one day (when free time allows it) refactor or better yet, rewrite the whole thing in order to utilise proper object oriented methodology.
